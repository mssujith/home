## Statistical Estimation of Seismic Source Signature

Seismic source signature estimation is an essential problem in exploration seismology. There are many ways to estimate the source signature. 
One of the most important methods of estimating source signaal is by deconvolution of the recorded response with the actual Earthâ€™s response signature. 
In this project, we created an algorithm to estimate the source signature by Virtual-Real Source Method [Behura and Snieder, 2013] 
and made some modifications for only one single recorded sigal.

## Estimation and Execution of Time Shift in 4D Time Lapse Seismics

Time lapse seismics have created a breakthrough in the field of reservoir monitoring and to Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) methods. The one of the important procedure
is to match the monitor data with baseline data. In order to do so, the time shift has to be estimated. So we created an algorith to estimate the time shift between
monitor and baseline data and also we tried to execute the index variant time shift to monitor trace for matching it with the baseline.
